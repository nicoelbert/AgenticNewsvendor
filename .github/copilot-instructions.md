# AgenticNewsvendor Research Project

This is a research project focused on data generation, dashboard visualization, and agentic LangChain system integration.

## Project Structure
- `data_generation/` - Data generation modules
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard and visualization components  
- `agentic_system/` - LangChain-based agentic system
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for testing and development
- `tests/` - Unit tests
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `docker/` - Docker configuration (for future containerization)

## Development Workflow
- Use Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` directory for initial testing and prototyping
- Modular design with clean separation of concerns
- Future deployment via Docker containers

## Key Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- LangChain for agentic systems
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive development
- Dashboard framework (to be determined based on requirements)
- Docker for containerization (future)
